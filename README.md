# Fusselsoft-Home-Controller
useful and user specific smart home via microcontroller by atmel

(more specific docu is coming soon.)

First prototyp state was a simple blinking of the light arc (without FUVM usage).

I will upload some videos soon and post a link here.

software can target a 7 segment output, can read distance from ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)

**Goal is:**
* writing a lite "Operating System" for Atmel CPUs for home automation purpose which comes with:
* * a cooperative scheduler
* * simple user interface tools
* * some tools for sitance sensor
* * a tool for blinking of a christmas arch (Schwibbogen)
* * some eays network tools for communicating with other atmels and raspberry pi for information interchange
