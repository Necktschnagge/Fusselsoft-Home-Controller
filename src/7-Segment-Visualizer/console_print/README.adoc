= 7 Segment Console Printer

== Content In General
- This program was written longer time ago and is now labled as deprecated.
- The code is about to "draw" the character set in 7 Segment layout to the console.
- It has a hardcoded charset, especially no reference to the current charset code from the main project.
- It has, even if not necessary, no comments.

== Disadvantages:
- You need to tap through by typing ENTER again and again.
- The shape of 7Segs is neither kind of pretty nor close to reality.
- This README is actually bigger than the source code.
